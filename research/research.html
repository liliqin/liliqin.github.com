		<h1>Roles of cell cycle kinase CDKs in mitochondrial homeostasis in cellular radiation response</h1>
		<p class="meta">2013 - present <br />UC Davis Department of Radiation Oncology, UC Davis Cancer Center, Sacramento, CA</p>
		<div class="text">
			<p>Mammalian cells are able to induce an adaptive response to enhance their survival under certain 
				genotoxic stress conditions including ionizing radiation. However, the exact mechanism causing 
				such adaptive radiation response is unknown. Mitochondrial homeostasis is proven actively 
				involved in radiation induced cellular adaptive response. Elucidate the mechanisms underlying 
				radiation-induced mitochondrial homeostasis will help to develop efficient strategy to improve 
				the outcome of tumor radiotherapy and protect normal cells from radiation-associated injury.</p>
			<p>Radiation induces DNA damage and repair of damaged DNA is an energy consuming process; however, 
				it is unclear how DNA repair is fueled and whether mitochondrial energy production contributes 
				to nuclear DNA repair. We found that sublethal dose (5 Gy) of radiation enhances mitochondrial 
				ATP generation, which is paralleled with enhanced mitochondrial relocation of cell cycle kinase 
				CDK1 and nuclear DNA repair capacity. More interestingly, mitochondria targeting expression of 
				kinase deficient mutant CDK1 significantly reverses radiation-enhanced mitochondrial ATP 
				generation and inhibits DNA repair; and overexpression of CDK1 phosphorylation deficient 
				mitochondrial respiratory chain complex I (CI) subunits compromises radiation-enhanced 
				mitochondria ATP generation. These results suggest a unique mechanism governing the communication 
				between mitochondria and nucleus, in which mitochondria-relocated CDK1 boosts cellular 
				bioenergetics to meet the increased cellular fuel demand for DNA repair and cell survival under 
				genotoxic stress.</p>
			<p>Recently, we reported that a small fraction of Cyclin B1/CDK1 is localized in the mitochondrial 
				matrix, which is further enriched at late G2 phase and phosphorylates a cluster of CI subunits. 
				CDK1-mediated CI subunit phosphorylation boosts mitochondrial ATP generation, allowing cells to 
				sense and respond to increased energy demand for G2/M transition for successful cell-cycle 
				progression (2, 7). Interestingly, Cyclin D1/CDK4 is also found relocated in mitochondria under 
				low dose ionizing radiation, where it phosphorylates MnSOD, causing enhanced MnSOD activity and 
				mitochondrial respiration, allowing cells to sense environmental genotoxic stress to improve 
				cell survival (5). Meanwhile, we found that sublethal dose (5 Gy) of radiation induces a feture 
				of energy shift from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in multiple types of 
				tumor cell including breast cancer, colon cancer and glioma brain tumor cells (6), and that 
				CDK1-mediated posttranslational modulation (phosphorylation) of mitochondrial proteins 
				(e.g. SIRT3) results in enhanced mitochondrial bioenergetics and mitochondria homeostasis, 
				which may contribute to the adaptive radioresistance in colon cancer cells (3). Accumulating 
				evidence indicated that cancer stem cells contribute to tumor radioresistance, but the 
				mechanisms is not clear. We have rescently isolated fractionated ionizing radiation 
				(FIR)-surviving clones from multiple types of tumor cells and found that this FIR-surviving 
				population represent cancer stem cell and aggressiveness features and alteration of 
				mitochondrial energy metabolism (data not published), suggesting that these small population 
				of stem-like FIR-surviving cells may contribute to cancer radioresistance and relapse. 
				Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying cancer stem cell radioresistance will provide new 
				targets to improve the outcome of cancer therapy.</p>

		<h1>Identification of <em>cis</em>-regulatory elements of <em>nautilus</em> gene in <em>Drosophila</em></h1>
		<p class="meta">2010 - 2012 <br />LBMB, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD</p>
		<div class="text">
			<p>A <em>cis</em>-regulatory element is a non-coding DNA sequence in or near a gene required for proper 
				spatiotemporal expression of that gene, often containing binding sites for transcription 
				factors. We identified <em>cis</em>-regulatory elements of nautilus gene in <em>Drosophila</em> 
				as a start to study how this gene's expression is regulated.</p>
			<p>We predicted some conserved sequences in 8kb upstream region and introns of nautilus gene as its 
				tentative cis-regulatory elements with a bioinformatics tool, <em>EvoPrinter</em>, which employs a 
				modified BLAT algorithm (enhanced BLAT) to compare alignments between evolutionarily distant genomes 
				(12 Drosophila genomes in this case). Then Gal4-UAS reporter system and RNA in situ hybridization in 
				Drosophila embryos were done to verify those sequences. Six sequences were proven involved in the 
				regulation of nautilus gene expression in different spacial and temporal manner.</p>

			<p>Gene targeting is a genetic technique that uses homologous recombination to change an endogenous 
				gene.Ends-in makes use of p-element transposon insertion, FLP-FRT site-specific recombination 
				system, I-SceI rare-cutting endonuclease mediated DSB and homologous recombination (HR) repair 
				system to target desired mutation into the interest locus in the genome (Rong, Y. Science, 288, 
				2013-2018, 2000). 
				PhiC31 integrase mediates sequence-directed, irreversible and highly efficient integration between 
				a bacterial attachment site (attB) and a phage attachment site (attP). 
				SIRT combines phiC31-mediated site-specific 
				integration and ends-in targeting to generate mutations of a gene at its endogenous locus.  
				An attP site is firstly targeted to the interest locus through ends-in targeting and subsequent 
				reduction. Further modifications of the same locus are introduced by integration of an 
				attB-containing plasmid with a modified target locus. Thereafter, a series of modification of the 
				same target locus can be introduced repeatedly with once attP placement step. It is a laber- and 
				time-saving tool that allows repeated modifications of a gene, including single amino acid 
				replacements, small domain deletion and complete deletion (Gao, G. PNAS, 105(37), 13999 –14004, 2008).</p>

			<p>Using SIRT, we established a transgenic fly line with an attP site inserted into nautilus gene 
				in Drosophila genome, which can be used to study the function of nautilus gene by repeatedly 
				introducing a series of modifications. It has been used in a study for deletion of entire 3’UTR region 
				and mutations of some candidate miRNA binding sites to verify the targeting effect of series of 
				miRNAs on nautilus gene. In addition, based on this fly line, 3’ end tagged fly 
				line can be easily established and used in ChIP with the antibody to the tag to screen the 
				candidate targets of nautilus.</p>

		<div class="text">
			<p>Aurora-A, as a cell cycle regulator, has been reported overexpressed in many types of human 
				cancers, leading to centrosome amplification and aneuploidy, which can be a driving cause 
				of genomic instability and tumorigenesis. We found that overexpression of Aurora-A delays 
				Cyclin B1 degradation, resulting in an increased Cyclin B1 protein level, while Aurora-A 
				RNAi enhances Cyclin B1 degradation. Further study showed that Aurora-A interacts with 
				Cyclin B1 and inhibites ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Cyclin B1, which depends on 
				Aurora-A kinase activity. These results provide new insight into the mechanism of how

		<div class="text">
			<p>Antibodies are host proteins that are produced by the immune system in response to foreign 
				molecules that enter the body. These foreign molecules are called antigens, and their 
				molecular recognition by the immune system results in selective production of antibodies 
				that are able to bind the specific antigen. Antibodies are made by B-lymphocytes and 
				circulate throughout the blood and lymph where they bind to their specific antigen, 
				enabling it to be cleared from circulation.	This ability of animal immune systems to 
				produce antibodies capable of binding specifically to antigens can be harnessed to 
				manufacture probes for detection of molecules of interest in a variety of research and 
				diagnostic applications.</p>
			<p>Antibody production involves preparation of antigen samples and their safe injection into 
				laboratory or farm animals so as to evoke high expression levels of antigen-specific 
				antibodies in the serum, which can then be recovered from the animal. Polyclonal antibodies 
				are recovered directly from serum (bleeds). Monoclonal antibodies are produced by fusing 
				antibody-secreting spleen cells from immunized mice with immortal myeloma cell to create 
				monoclonal hybridoma cell lines that express the specific antibody and secrete into cell 
				culture supernatant.</p>
			<p>Using cTn-I protein isolated from patient heart or commercially synthesized cTn-I polypeptied, 
				we produced the high titer rabbit polyclonal antibody and mouse monoclonal antibody against 
				human cardiac troponin-I (cTn-I), which can be used in lab research and clinical diagnosis.</p>
