		<div class="text">
			<p>Mammalian cells are able to induce an adaptive protection against ionizing radiation, which is present on the earth surface and increasingly used in medical application and radiation industry. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying such adaptive response to genotoxic stress will help to develop effective approaches either to improve the outcome of cancer radiotherapy or to protect radiation associated injury. Recent studies showed that mitochondria is actively involved in radiation induced cellular response. I have been working on the role of mitochondria bioenergetics in radiation induced cellular response in normal cells, cancer cells and cancer stem cells. </p>

		<div class="text">
			<p>I recently worked on a long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) that may play a role in 
				<em>Drosophila</em> muscle development. This gene starts to express from stage 13 of 
				<em>Drosophila</em> embryo and its expression follows muscle pattern. It is located in 
				cytoplasm. Furthermore, overexpression and knockdown of this gene lead to disruption of 
				muscle pattern. I have also studied the possibility of this gene acting as miRNA sponge. 
				Screening of its associated proteins is also going on. </p>

		<div class="text">
			<p>A <em>cis</em>-regulatory element is a non-coding DNA sequence in or near a gene required for proper 
				spatiotemporal expression of that gene, often containing binding sites for transcription 
				factors. We identified condidate <em>cis</em>-regulatory elements of a muscle specific gene in 
				this study as a start to reveal how that gene's expression is regulated.</p>
			<p>We predicted some conserved sequences in the 8kb upstream region and the introns of this gene as its 
				tentative cis-regulatory elements with a computational tool, <em>EvoPrinter</em>, which employs a 
				modified BLAT algorithm (enhanced BLAT) to compare alignments between evolutionarily distant genomes 
				(12 Drosophila genomes in this case). Gene reporter assay (Gal4-UAS system) was done thereafter to 
				verify those sequences. Six sequences have been proven working as enhancers</p>

			<p>Gene targeting is a genetic technique that uses homologous recombination to change an endogenous 
				gene.Ends-in makes use of p-element transposon insertion, FLP-FRT site-specific recombination 
				system, I-SceI rare-cutting endonuclease mediated DSB and homologous recombination (HR) repair 
				system to target desired mutation into the interest locus in the genome (Rong, Y. Science, 288, 
				2013-2018, 2000). 
				PhiC31 integrase mediates sequence-directed, irreversible and highly efficient integration between 
				a bacterial attachment site (attB) and a phage attachment site (attP). 
				SIRT combines phiC31-mediated site-specific 
				integration and ends-in targeting to generate mutations of a gene at its endogenous locus.  
				An attP site is firstly targeted to the interest locus through ends-in targeting and subsequent 
				reduction. Further modifications of the same locus are introduced by integration of an 
				attB-containing plasmid with a modified target locus. Thereafter, a series of modification of the 
				same target locus can be introduced repeatedly with once attP placement step. It is a laber- and 
				time-saving tool that allows repeated modifications of a gene, including single amino acid 
				replacements, small domain deletion and complete deletion (Gao, G. PNAS, 105(37), 13999 –14004, 2008).</p>

		<div class="text text-2 left">
			<p>Using SIRT, I already established an attP-placement fly line with an attP site inserted into a 
				muscle-specific gene, which makes it possible to rapidly generate varieties of desired mutation 
				of that gene repeatedly. This fly line has been used in a study for deletion of entire 3’UTR region 
				and mutations of some candidate miRNA binding sites to verify the targeting effect of series of
				miRNAs on that gene. In addition, based on this fly line, 3’ end tagged fly line can be easily 
				established and used in ChIP with the antibody to the tag to screen the candidate targets of that gene.</p>

	    <h1>Aurora-A interacts with Cyclin B1 and plays a role in tumorigenesis</h1>
	    <p class="meta">2006 - 2008 <br />State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Cancer Institute, 
			Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Beijing, China</p>
		<div class="text">
			<p>The  mitotic regulator Aurora-A is an oncogenic protein that is over-expressed in  many types 
	            of human tumors. This study focused on the underlying mechanism  through which Aurora-A  
	            promotes tumorigenesis. In Aim 1, we screen the downstream targets of Aurora-A. We found 
	            that Aurora-A induces expression  changes of many proteins implicated in signaling pathways of 
	            cell cycle control  and apoptosis. In Aim 2, we concentrate on the molecular mechanism of 
	            Aurora-A in cell cycle  control and in tumorigenesis. We found that overexpression of Aurora-A 
	            causes an elevation of Cyclin B1  expression. Cyclin B1 degradation is delayed in Aurora-A  
	            over-expressing cells, which depends on Aurora-A  kinase activity. In contrast, Aurora-A RNAi 
	            enhances Cyclin B1 degradation. Furthermore, we found that Aurora-A overexpression reduces the  
	            interaction of Cyclin B1 with APC subunits.  In human esophageal squamous  cell carcinomas (ESCC), 
	            overexpression of Aurora-A  was correlated with deregulated expression of Cyclin B1. Taken 
	            together, these findings  suggest that overexpression of Aurora-A  may stabilize Cyclin B1 
	            through inhibiting its Ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Meanwhile, we found that Aurora-A 
	            interacts with Cyclin B1. Then the  interaction domains and the role of Aurora-A  kinase 
	            activity in the interaction were investigated. These results may provide new insight into the 
	            mechanism of how  deregulated Aurora-A contributes to genomic instability and carcinogenesis.</p>

			<p>Antibodies are host proteins that are produced by the immune system in response to foreign 
				molecules that enter the body. These foreign molecules are called antigens, and their 
				molecular recognition by the immune system results in selective production of antibodies 
				that are able to bind the specific antigen. Antibodies are made by B-lymphocytes and 
				circulate throughout the blood and lymph where they bind to their specific antigen, 
				enabling it to be cleared from circulation.	This ability of animal immune systems to 
				produce antibodies capable of binding specifically to antigens can be harnessed to 
				manufacture probes for detection of molecules of interest in a variety of research and 
				diagnostic applications.</p>
			<p>Antibody production involves preparation of antigen samples and their safe injection into 
				laboratory or farm animals so as to evoke high expression levels of antigen-specific 
				antibodies in the serum, which can then be recovered from the animal. Polyclonal antibodies 
				are recovered directly from serum (bleeds). Monoclonal antibodies are produced by fusing 
				antibody-secreting spleen cells from immunized mice with immortal myeloma cell to create 
				monoclonal hybridoma cell lines that express the specific antibody and secrete into cell 
				culture supernatant.</p>
